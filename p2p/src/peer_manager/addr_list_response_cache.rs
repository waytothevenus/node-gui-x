/// The idea is to remember the addresses in the first AddrListResponse and return the same list
/// to all peers until its expiration time is reached. This way, even if the attacker connects
/// to the node multiple times, it won't learn any additional addresses from this.
/// There is a caveat though - if the node has multiple listening addresses, this straightforward
/// approach will allow the attacker to identify them as belonging to the same node. So instead
/// of one address list we cache multiple lists indexed by an id that is produced by hashing
/// the local address.
